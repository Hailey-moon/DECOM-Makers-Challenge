# Welcome
This is a submission to DECOM 2024 Makers Challenge.

Relax as you watch Card Tech+'s beautiful logo spin slowly, or take matters into your own hands and spin the logo yourself with your mouse. You can also scroll to zoom in and out into the model.

## How did I make this?
TL;DR: This project was made using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and GitHub Pages.

When this challenge was announced, my first idea was to create something with a beloved UI/UX prototyping tool, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). However, I had just lost access to the free educational license, and Capital One did not liberally hand the license out to everyone. But I still wanted to stick with something visual, interactive, and new (for me).

Three.js is a free and open-source JavaScript library for creating beautiful, animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. You set the scene, put down a camera, set up lights, and work your magic—quite literally, "lights, camera, action!"

But all this to say, the first few steps in this project were not coding. It was with more free, open-source tools I had never touched before.

1. I took the Card Tech+ logo and turned it into an [SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).

 2. I then uploaded to Blender to turn this 2D SVG file into a 3D model data file in GLB.

Then having saved this to the file type Three.js documentation recommends, uploaded it into this repo and started playing around with it.
