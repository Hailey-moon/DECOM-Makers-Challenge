# Welcome
This is a submission to DECOM 2024 Makers Challenge.

Relax as you watch Card Tech+'s beautiful logo spin slowly, or take matters into your own hands and spin the logo yourself with your mouse. You can also scroll to zoom in and out into the model.

## How did I make this?
TL;DR: This project was made using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), and GitHub Pages.

My first idea when this challenge was announced was to create something with a beloved UI/UX prototyping tool, [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). However, I had just lost access to the free educational license, and Capital One did not liberally hand the license out to everyone. But I still wanted to stick with something visual, interactive, and new (for me).

Three.js is a free and open source JavaScript library used to create beautiful, animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. You set the scene, put down a camera, set up lights, and work your magic. Quite literally "lights, camera, action!"

But all this to saym first real step in this project was not coding. It was with another free, open source tool I have never touched before, Blender.

I took the Card Tech+ logo, turned it into an [SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), then uploaded to Blender to turn this 2D file into a 3D model.

Then having saved this to the file type Three.js documentation recommends, uploaded it into this repo and started playing around with just what I could make of it. It took quite a bit of research to get it to refract the background through the model, and I'm satisfied for now.

GitHub pages is GitHub's way to host sites easily, and GitHub Actions is their own CI/CD tool.
